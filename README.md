# Exploring gene expression regulation by enhancers through single cell analysis

This repository provides scripts for data analysis and figure generation 

## Script
- Shareseqcoex.py: Script to identify gene-enhancer associations.
- SHARE_EPIMAP_ABCmodel_cor.R : Script to compare SHARE-seq gene-enhancer associations with EpiMap and ABCmodel. 
- Enhancers_co-activity_1.R : Script to identify active enhancer across the same gene and cell.
- Enhancers_co-activity_2.R : Script to create a list of enhancers across the same gene and cell.
- co-active_enhancers_plots.R : Script to explore enhancers co-activity
- co-activity_abundance.R : Script to study the abundance of enhancers co-activity.
- co-active_enhancers_distance.R : Script to explore distance between pairs of co-active enhancers
- SHARE_seq_Distance.R : Script to explore Absolute distance distribution between significant associations and all
associations.
